    1. What information do we collect from Jobseekers on our sites, how do we use them and what should you be aware of?
1.1 "myerp.jobs"
For "myerp.jobs" and our other services listed below, you can either register directly by entering your data on our website.

When you register with "myerp.jobs", we will first save your email address so that we can send you the erp.jobs Services.

The personal datas which we collect for your job application along with your CV includes your email address, name, address, phone number, mobile phone number, photo, gender, citizenship and date of birth ("Personal User Information"). Personal User Information will be kept strictly confidential and will not be shared with potential employers unless you create an active, public CV or give us your express consent. In addition, you have the opportunity to pass on this data – to a potential employer - as far as you expressly authorize it. We already asked for certain datas (email, gender, name, postal code, date of birth) when you sign up in "myerp.jobs". However, you can leave these open (except for the active email address) as long as you do not want to create a CV. When you create a CV, you have to enter different mandatory dates. These can be recognized by the respective asterisk. Incidentally, the storage of personal information is completely optional and voluntary. In particular, we can use the personal data collected in this way to send you offers from potential employers in other ways as well. In order to ensure your proper registration, that is, to prevent unauthorized log-ins on behalf of third parties, we will send you a confirmation email after your registration requesting confirmation of registration.

In doing so, we not only send you job applications published on erp.jobs, but also other applications from selected partners. erp.jobs can contact you by e-mail or by phone.

However, they can also be published freely accessible on the Internet or sent by email or print to interested potential employers in order to increase the penetration rate and thus the response. Our pages are accessible worldwide via the internet.

Rather, they help us to provide tailor-made and more efficient services for you and are therefore beneficial for all involved. However, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data by us on this basis. Please note that in some jurisdictions in which we operate, in certain cases a different legal basis may apply to the processing of data.

We need to do this so that we can work economically and help you and other candidates get the jobs they deserve.

Right to revoke your consent:

If you have given us your consent to process your personal data for certain activities, you may revoke this consent at any time.
