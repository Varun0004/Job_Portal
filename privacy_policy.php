The personal datas which we collect for your job application along with your CV includes your email address, name, address, phone number, mobile phone number, photo, gender, citizenship and date of birth ("Personal User Information"). Personal User Information will be kept strictly confidential and will not be shared with potential employers unless you create an active, public CV or give us your express consent. In addition, you have the opportunity to pass on this data â€“ to a potential employer - as far as you expressly authorize it. We already asked for certain datas (email, gender, name, postal code, date of birth) when you sign up in "myerp.jobs". However, you can leave these open (except for the active email address) as long as you do not want to create a CV. When you create a CV, you have to enter different mandatory dates. These can be recognized by the respective asterisk. Incidentally, the storage of personal information is completely optional and voluntary. In particular, we can use the personal data collected in this way to send you offers from potential employers in other ways as well.

Privacy Shield Framework for the transfer of personal data of companies in the EU to companies in the US or an equivalent agreement between other jurisdictions, or the transfer of your data to a country in which a legally required level of data protection is appropriate by the European Commission or if it is necessary for the conclusion or settlement of a contract between us and a third party and the transfer for the purpose of this contract is in your interest (for example, if we have to provide data outside the EWR, to our obligations under this contract to comply with) or if you have given your consent for the transmission of data.

To ensure that your personal data receives adequate levels of protection, we have implemented appropriate measures with third parties with whom we share your personal data in order to ensure that your personal data  is obtained from these third parties in a consistent manner with data protection  which is consistent with data protection laws.

8. Our legal basis for the processing of your data

Rather, they help us to provide tailor-made and more efficient services for you and are therefore beneficial for all involved. However, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data by us on this basis. Please note that in some jurisdictions in which we operate, in certain cases a different legal basis may apply to the processing of data.

Candidate data (myerp.jobs): We believe that if you are looking for a job or have posted the information from your CV to a job portal or professional networking site, we may agree that we collect or use your personal information, to provide or provide you with recruiting services that we may share this information with potential employers and match your skills with the vacancies available to us.

If you are being considered for a job, the prospective employer might want to review the information you have provided to us. We need to do this so that we can work economically and help you and other candidates get the jobs they deserve. We'd like to provide you with tailored job recommendations and relevant articles to help you to find a job. Therefore, we consider it appropriate that we process your data to ensure that we send you appropriate content.

One of the main objectives of the DSGVOis to protect and clarify the data protection rights of EU citizens and individuals within the EU. This means that you continue to have different rights to your data, even if you have already given it to us. These rights are described in more detail below.

If you object to direct advertising, we will need to stop this activity.

Right to revoke your consent:

If you have given us your consent to process your personal data for certain activities, you may revoke this consent at any time.
